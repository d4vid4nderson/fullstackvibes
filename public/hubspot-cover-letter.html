        Dear HubSpot Hiring Team,
    </div>

    <div class="body">
        <p>
            When I read your job posting asking for someone to "ship AI tools that teams depend on daily," I immediately thought: that's exactly what I've been doing for the past three years. You're building AI-powered tools for a 250+ person design organization. I've been building AI-powered tools for an 800+ person architectural firm. You need someone who can prototype quickly, deploy to production, and drive adoption. That's been my entire career trajectory—just compressed into three intense years instead of spread across ten.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's my honest pitch: <strong class="highlight">I've shipped 6 production applications in 3 years</strong> that collectively delivered <strong class="highlight">$40,000+ in annual cost savings and 80% efficiency gains</strong> across an 800+ person organization. These aren't side projects or proof-of-concepts—they're mission-critical tools that people depend on daily for everything from legislative compliance automation (20,000+ documents analyzed) to architectural planning workflows that replaced entire manual processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes my approach directly relevant to this role is <strong>how I build AI-augmented systems</strong>. I don't just use AI as a coding assistant—I architect production applications that integrate Claude AI, Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), and other AI services to solve real workflow problems. I've built full-stack applications (Python, Go, React, Vue, HTMX), deployed them to production, driven user adoption, and measured their business impact. This is exactly what you're asking for: "demonstrated experience building production AI API integrations" and "proven fluency with LLM integration and generative AI services."
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Concrete examples from my portfolio:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>LegislationVUE (Developer):</strong> Eliminated $40,000+ in annual legal consulting costs by automating analysis of 20,000+ state and federal legislative documents using Azure OpenAI (GPT-4). Transforms 8-hour manual reviews into instant insights. Built with Python, React, FastAPI, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Docker, Claude AI, and Playwright.</li>
            <li><strong>PlanVUE (Product Owner):</strong> Achieved 80% efficiency gain for architectural planners by eliminating manual data entry and collection. AI-enhanced workflows automatically generate project deliverables with multi-stakeholder approval chains and real-time health monitoring. Built with Go, HTMX, PostgreSQL, Claude, Tailwind CSS, Docker, Playwright. Currently being prepared for commercial release to school districts nationwide.</li>
            <li><strong>InitiativeVUE (Developer):</strong> Broke down organizational silos by providing C-suite with unified visibility into cross-departmental initiatives previously tracked in isolation. Real-time executive dashboard enables data-driven strategic decision making. Built with Go, Azure, Docker, Tailwind CSS, Claude, Playwright.</li>
            <li><strong>SharePointVUE (Developer):</strong> Automated SharePoint testing and WCAG accessibility compliance using Playwright and Claude AI. Detects broken links, generates multi-format reports, and reduces manual QA time while improving site reliability. Built with Go, Azure, Docker, Tailwind CSS, Claude, Playwright.</li>
            <li><strong>FacilityVUE (Product Owner):</strong> Recently shipped facility management platform currently being prepared for commercial release to school districts nationwide. Demonstrates transition from internal tooling to market-ready software product with scalable multi-tenant architecture. Built with Go, HTMX, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Docker.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>My technical approach:</strong> I leverage AI not just in the products I build, but in how I build them—using LLMs as development accelerators while maintaining product ownership, system design, and quality standards throughout the full lifecycle. I work across the entire stack: database design (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), backend development (Go, Python/FastAPI), frontend implementation (React, Vue, HTMX, Tailwind CSS), AI integrations (Azure OpenAI, Claude), testing automation (Playwright), and containerized deployment (Docker, Azure).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Here's how my background aligns with what you're looking for:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Build AI-powered tools that enhance workflows":</strong> I've built 6 production applications with AI integrations (Azure OpenAI, Claude AI) that transformed workflows for planning, legislative analysis, testing, and initiative tracking across multiple departments.</li>
            <li><strong>"Full-stack development expertise":</strong> I work across the entire stack—Python/FastAPI, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Vue, HTMX, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker. I design database schemas, build APIs, create interfaces, and deploy to production.</li>
            <li><strong>"Production AI API integrations":</strong> LegislationVUE uses Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) in production to analyze 20,000+ legislative documents. InitiativeVUE and SharePointVUE integrate Claude AI for executive insights and accessibility analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>"Drive organizational change through internal tooling":</strong> I convinced a traditional architecture firm to adopt AI-powered workflows, achieved 80% efficiency gains that convinced leadership to greenlight commercial product development, and eliminated $40K+ in annual consulting costs through automation.</li>
            <li><strong>"Partner cross-functionally":</strong> I've worked directly with executives, planners, legal teams, facilities managers, and IT departments to understand workflows, gather requirements, and drive adoption of new tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What excites me about this role:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scale of impact:</strong> Everything I've built has been for an 800+ person architectural firm with teams ranging from 50-400 people. Building tools for a 250+ person design organization at HubSpot—serving millions of customers—represents exactly the kind of scale I'm ready for.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-first culture:</strong> You're not bolting AI onto existing workflows as an afterthought. You're fundamentally rethinking how design and research teams operate in an AI-native world. That's the future I want to build.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical standards:</strong> Your emphasis on "high standards for internal tool quality, user adoption, and workflow transformation" matches exactly how I approach product development. I don't build proof-of-concepts; I build production systems that people depend on.</li>
            <li><strong>Experimentation mindset:</strong> Your job posting talks about "modeling technical curiosity and AI fluency." That's precisely my approach—rapid prototyping, continuous learning, and bias toward action over perfection.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Addressing the experience gap honestly:</strong> I have 3 years of focused AI tool development, not 10+ years across design technology roles. But here's what those 3 years represent: shipping production code daily, driving real business outcomes, and proving that AI-augmented development isn't just faster—it's fundamentally different. I've compressed a decade of learning into three years because I had to build everything from scratch with no template to follow.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your job posting explicitly states that HubSpot values diverse backgrounds and encourages applications from those who might not match every qualification perfectly. I'm betting that my track record of shipping production AI tools, driving measurable business impact, and operating as a full-stack developer with AI fluency is exactly what you mean by "diverse backgrounds."
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What I bring that's hard to teach:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Real production experience with LLM APIs (not just experimentation)</li>
            <li>Full ownership mindset—I architect, build, deploy, and support everything I ship</li>
            <li>Track record of user adoption—my tools are mission-critical, not abandoned prototypes</li>
            <li>Ability to translate AI capabilities into workflow transformations</li>
            <li>Comfort with ambiguity and rapid iteration in emerging technology spaces</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I'd love to discuss how my unconventional path—building AI-powered internal tools for a traditional industry—translates to helping HubSpot's design organization work faster, smarter, and more creatively. You can view my portfolio at <a href="https://fullstackvibes.io" class="highlight">fullstackvibes.io</a> to see detailed breakdowns of each project, or I'm happy to do a technical walkthrough of any application.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm not the candidate with the longest resume, but I might be the one who best understands where you're trying to go—and how to get there quickly.
        </p>

        Thank you for considering my application.
